# Predict the airplane seats that are being occupied in the first class of a flight

In this practical exercise, our focus is on utilizing the SAP HANA Machine Learning (ML) algorithm to predict the occupancy of first-class seats on flights APL Library This predictive capability opens up a world of possibilities for companies, enabling them to optimize their aircraft selection and the allocation of first-class seats.
By successfully predicting seat occupancy, the company gains valuable insights that can inform decisions about the ideal aircraft type for different flights and the optimal number of first-class seats to offer. This level of intelligence can greatly enhance operational efficiency and improve the overall customer experience.
To execute this exercise, we will leverage the Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM) framework. ISLM serves as the foundation for creating and managing ML use cases seamlessly within the SAP S/4HANA stack.

This exercise includes the following steps:

1.	**Creating a New Intelligent Scenario**: <br/> We will begin by creating a new intelligent scenario that will encompass the predictive model for first-class seat occupancy.
2.	**Operating the Intelligent Scenario**:<br/> Once the scenario is set up, we will operate it to enable the prediction process.
3.	**Visualizing Model Version Predictions**: <br/> This step involves visualizing the predictions generated by the model versions within the intelligent scenario.

By the end of this exercise, participants will have gained hands-on experience in utilizing the ISLM framework and SAP HANA ML algorithm to enhance decision-making processes and improve customer experiences.


## 1. Create Intelligent Scenario
The Intelligent Scenarios app is used to create intelligent scenarios, review, and publish them, and to make them available in the Intelligent Scenario Management app.
In this step, youâ€™ll create a new intelligent scenario to predict the airplane seats occupation in the first class of a flight using SAP HANA ML algorithm.

For this use case we will use regression model with Gradient Boosting algorithm.
SAP HANA APL lets you build and apply different types of predictive models, such as classification, regression, and time series forecasting models. 
Gradient Boosting regression model type provides a more accurate modeling result than the legacy regression model.
