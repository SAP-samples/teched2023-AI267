# Predict the plane type of an aircraft

In this exercise, we are going to predict the plane type of an aircraft using SAP BTP based ML service Data Attribute Recommendation. We will use the Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM) framework to create and operate the ML use case. 

Data Attribute Recommendation uses machine learning to predict and classify data records.<br>
With Data Attribute Recommendation you can
  -	Automate and speed up data management processes
  -	Reduce errors and manual efforts in data maintenance
  -	Increase data consistency and accuracy

This exercise includes the following steps: 
1. Create and publish Intelligent Scenario.
2. Set up the connection for Intelligent Scenario to connect to BTP based ML service.
3. Use Intelligent Scenario Management app to train, view model quality, deploy and activate the model.
4. View the inference result returned by the model in an ABAP report.

## 1. Create and publish Intelligent Scenario

The Intelligent Scenarios app is used to create intelligent scenarios, review, and publish them, and to make them available in the Intelligent Scenario Management app. In this step, you’ll create a new intelligent scenario to predict the plane type using SAP BTP based ML service Data Attribute Recommendation. 

1. Create a Prediction Class which defines the behavior of the scenario.<br>

   Prediction class has methods to specify Inference type and ML Template for Data Attribute Recommendation. 
   For this use case, we will use generic template which make use of Classification algorithm.<br>

   
   Open **SAP Logon** and logon to system **HE4 400** <br>
   Open transaction **/nse24** and search for the class **ZCL_PLANTYPE_HO**
